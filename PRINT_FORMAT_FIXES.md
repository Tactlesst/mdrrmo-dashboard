# Print Format Fixes - Improved Layout

## Issues Fixed

Based on the print preview screenshots, the following formatting issues were addressed:

### Problem 1: Too Much White Space (Image 1)
**Before:** Content was spread out with excessive spacing
**After:** Compact, efficient use of space

### Problem 2: Text Too Small in 2-Column (Image 2)  
**Before:** 7.5pt font was too cramped and hard to read
**After:** Increased to 8pt labels, better line height

### Problem 3: Messy Layout
**Before:** Inconsistent spacing, poor organization
**After:** Clean, professional layout with proper alignment

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Optimized Font Sizes**
```css
Labels: 8pt (increased from 7.5pt)
Text: 7.5pt (maintained)
Line height: 1.25 (increased from 1.2)
```
- More readable while still compact
- Better balance between size and space

### 2. **Better Spacing**
```css
Padding: 5px (increased from 4px)
Margins: 5px (increased from 4px)
Gaps: 4px (increased from 3px)
Column gap: 15px (increased from 12px)
```
- Not too cramped, not too spread out
- Comfortable reading experience

### 3. **Compact Header**
```css
Logo: 10px × 10px (reduced from 12px)
Header text: 7pt (reduced from 8pt)
Title: 11pt (reduced from 12pt)
Layout: Centered logo with text
```
- Takes less vertical space
- More professional appearance
- Logo and text aligned horizontally

### 4. **Smart Grid Layout**
```css
Grids: Display as block in columns
Multi-column spans: Converted to single column
Line breaks: Converted to commas for compactness
```
- Better flow in 2-column layout
- No awkward breaks
- Efficient use of space

### 5. **Column Optimization**
```css
Column count: 2
Column gap: 15px (wider for clarity)
Column rule: 1px solid #ccc (lighter color)
Break inside: avoid (keeps sections together)
```
- Balanced columns
- Clear separation
- Sections don't split
